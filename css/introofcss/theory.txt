CSS Types in HTML

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style web pages (colors, fonts, layouts, etc.).
There are 3 main ways to apply CSS in HTML:

âœ… 1. External CSS

CSS is written in a separate file (example: style.css).

That file is linked inside the <head> of the HTML using <link>.

Best for big projects because all pages can use the same CSS file.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">


ðŸ“Œ Advantages:

Cleaner code (HTML and CSS separate).

Easy to update style for multiple pages.

ðŸ“Œ Disadvantages:

Needs an extra CSS file.

Page may load slightly slower (because it loads 2 files).

âœ… 2. Internal CSS

CSS is written inside the HTML file, in the <head> section, inside <style>.

Affects only that page.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

<style>
    h1 { color: green; }
</style>


ðŸ“Œ Advantages:

No extra file needed.

Good for small projects or single page websites.

ðŸ“Œ Disadvantages:

Styles apply only to that page.

Not good for big projects.

âœ… 3. Inline CSS

CSS is written directly inside an HTML tag using the style attribute.

Used for quick changes or testing.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

<h1 style="color: red;">Hello</h1>


ðŸ“Œ Advantages:

Very quick and easy to apply.

No need for <style> or separate file.

ðŸ“Œ Disadvantages:

Messy code if used too much.

Hard to maintain (styles scattered inside HTML).
